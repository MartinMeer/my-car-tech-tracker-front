## FIX IT! ##
✅ New car creating: year selector don't select a needed date
✅ Cover: remove icons from login/pswd
✅ Register.html: remove icons from all fields

✅ Unify car name representations in all pages
✅ add-car: make mileage field not required because it is not static info, controls by dynamic monitor
6. add-car: when cancel without saving, opens a old car-list page.
✅ add-car: integrate mileage to technical-state-section, because it is not static info, controls by dynamic monitor
8. my-car-overview: in tech-state-header, a selection by date is not working
9. service-history: when save&close, return back to service-history page
