 Let's implement add-to-plan funcionality on my-car-overview. It means carete interactions between corresponded pages   
1. in alering section, for each entry, add В план button with restoring ability (as implemented for archiving btn)
2. On click, send entry to plan into a repairs-table and fill a row there.
    In alert section let this entry remain crosslined
    Mapping: date to date; {system, description} to operation; priority to notes section in form a comment string: Добавлено из уведомления от $date со статусом "$priority"; resource field in plan remain empty;
3. When restore in alert section OR delete in plan page:
- delete the entry from plan
